# Wheel of Heaven

> Wheel of Heaven is a multilingual knowledge base exploring the hypothesis that life on Earth was intelligently designed by an extraterrestrial civilization called the Elohim, as described in ancient religious texts and the Raelian revelations. The site covers ancient astronaut theory, biblical exegesis, cosmic chronology, and the intersection of science and spirituality.

The Wheel of Heaven hypothesis proposes that the Hebrew word "Elohim" in Genesis refers to an advanced extraterrestrial civilization who created life on Earth through genetic engineering. This interpretation draws from the Raelian movement's teachings, ancient astronaut theories, and comparative mythology across cultures.
