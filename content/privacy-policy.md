# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: September 2025**

## Overview

Wheel of Heaven is a purely static website with no backend infrastructure, databases, or server-side processing. This means we have very limited ability to collect, store, or process your personal data.

## What We Don't Collect

Since this is a static website, we do **not** collect:

- Personal information (names, email addresses, phone numbers)
- User accounts or login credentials
- Form submissions or user-generated content
- Analytics data or tracking information
- Cookies for tracking purposes
- IP addresses or location data

## What We May Collect

The only data collection that may occur is through:

### Third-Party Services

If we use any third-party services (such as analytics providers), they may collect data according to their own privacy policies. We will clearly disclose any such services and link to their privacy policies.

### Server Logs

Our hosting provider may maintain standard server logs that include:
- IP addresses
- Browser types
- Access times
- Pages visited

These logs are maintained by our hosting provider and are not accessible to us for tracking purposes.

## Data Sharing

We do not share any data with third parties, as we do not collect personal data through this website.

## Your Rights

Since we do not collect personal data:
- There is no personal data to access, modify, or delete
- No data portability requests are applicable
- No consent withdrawal is necessary

## Contact

If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please contact us through our GitHub repository or other publicly available contact methods.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date.
