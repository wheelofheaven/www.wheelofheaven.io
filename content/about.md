# Our Vision

We're the Wheel of Heaven community, a passionate group with a vision for exploring humanity's cosmic heritage and the profound implications of our extraterrestrial origins.

Wheel of Heaven isn't our first exploration into these mysteries. It's the culmination of decades of research, analysis, and synthesis of ancient texts, modern scientific discoveries, and cross-cultural mythologies. We've dedicated ourselves to understanding the profound questions of human origin, the nature of consciousness, and our place in the cosmic order. Building platforms for truth and understanding is in our DNA.

Now, we're building something new again with that same drive and a fresh perspective. We believe the most important discoveries come from open collaboration and rigorous inquiry. We believe humanity's story is far more extraordinary than conventionally taught. We believe there's a deeper truth about our origins waiting to be understood—and this is just the beginning of our journey.

We think there's a better way to explore humanity's cosmic heritage, and it starts with the following assumptions.

## Knowledge should be freely accessible to all

When you seek truth about humanity's origins, you shouldn't encounter paywalls or gatekeepers. Information that could reshape our understanding of human civilization should be available to every curious mind, regardless of their economic circumstances or institutional affiliations.

## Open dialogue produces better understanding

Academic papers have their place, but sometimes you just want to explore ideas together. It's more engaging than peer review, builds trust between researchers, and it's one of the best ways to distribute knowledge through a community. But it has to be welcoming.

If you want someone's perspective on an ancient text or scientific discovery, it should be as easy as starting a conversation and inviting them to explore the evidence together.

## Research should happen close to sources

If you want to discuss ancient texts, you should be able to reference the original sources directly, not just summaries or interpretations. By treating primary sources as the fundamental unit of evidence and integrating discussion around specific passages, we can make it easy to have conversations about any line of text in any translation—whether it was written millennia ago or discovered just yesterday.

## Truth should emerge organically

If you're exploring questions that could reshape our understanding of human civilization, every piece of evidence must be carefully considered. The content you're investigating should always be the focus. So we constantly ask ourselves how we can maximize signal and minimize noise. Our goal is to find the most effective way to present each piece of evidence and make it accessible. Meaningful discovery starts with research that stays true to the sources.
