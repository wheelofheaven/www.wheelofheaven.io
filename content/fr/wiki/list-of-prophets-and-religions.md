description = "Liste des prophètes et des religions. Beaucoup de religions, mais pas tout à fait, sont considérées comme des témoignages établis d'interactions authentiques entre les Elohim (אֱלֹהִים) et les humains sur Terre. Ces interactions conduisent à des écrits religieux et à des traditions orales qui témoignent des faits et gestes élohimiens. Cette liste va cataloguer de manière exhaustive dans une large mesure la majorité des traditions religieuses notables ainsi que les prophètes qui conduisent à de telles traditions."

There are several major world religions, each with their own unique beliefs and practices. Here is a brief overview of some of the most important religions:

- Christianity: Christianity is a monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. Christians believe in one God who created the universe and everything in it, and in the concept of the Holy Trinity – the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. The Bible is the primary sacred text for Christians, and the religion is based on the belief in salvation through faith in Jesus Christ.

- Islam: Islam is a monotheistic religion founded by the Prophet Muhammad in the 7th century. Muslims believe in one God, Allah, who is the same God worshiped by Jews and Christians. The Quran is the primary sacred text for Muslims, and the religion is based on the Five Pillars of Islam – declaration of faith, prayer, charity, fasting, and pilgrimage to Mecca.

- Judaism: Judaism is a monotheistic religion based on the belief in one God who revealed himself to Abraham, Moses, and the other prophets of the Hebrew Bible. The Torah is the primary sacred text for Jews, and the religion is based on the belief in the covenant between God and the Jewish people.

- Hinduism: Hinduism is a polytheistic religion with a diverse set of beliefs and practices that vary widely by region and culture. Hindus believe in a pantheon of gods and goddesses, with the ultimate reality being Brahman, the supreme godhead. The Vedas and Upanishads are the primary sacred texts for Hindus.

- Buddhism: Buddhism is a nontheistic religion founded by the Buddha, who taught that the path to enlightenment involves following the Eightfold Path and the Four Noble Truths. Buddhists believe in the concept of karma, rebirth, and the impermanence of all things. The Tripitaka is the primary sacred text for Buddhists.

- Sikhism: A monotheistic religion founded in the 15th century in India by Guru Nanak. Sikhism emphasizes the importance of selfless service, equality among all people, and the pursuit of spiritual enlightenment through devotion to the divine.

- Shintoism: A religion indigenous to Japan that emphasizes a belief in the existence of kami, or spirits, that inhabit natural features like mountains and rivers. Shintoism emphasizes purity and cleanliness, and includes a variety of rituals and festivals throughout the year.

- Taoism: A Chinese religion and philosophy that emphasizes the concept of Tao, or the way, as the ultimate reality and source of all things. Taoism encourages simplicity, humility, and a deep respect for nature and the interconnectedness of all things.
