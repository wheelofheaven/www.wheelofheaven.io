"The Revelation of the Pyramids," a French documentary directed by Patrice Pooyard and released in 2010, delves into pseudo-historical theories proposed by Jacques Grimault. Grimault's unpublished works suggest a slow cycle of geological changes on Earth, including shifts in magnetic poles, causing catastrophic events every 26,000 years. He theorizes that an ancient civilization, predating ours, was destroyed by these catastrophes, and that they built the Pyramids of Giza and other ancient structures. These structures, he claims, were not primarily tombs but mathematical riddles, warning of this cyclical disaster.

The film also claims that the Giza pyramid complex and other archaeological sites like Easter Island and Machu Picchu are aligned on a "leaning equator," positioned equidistant from the Earth's magnetic poles. This alignment is theorized to be part of a larger framework that views pyramids as energy generators.
