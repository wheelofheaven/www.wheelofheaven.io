# The Great Cosmic Timeline

Embark on an extraordinary journey through time itself—a 26,000-year odyssey that reveals the true history of Earth and humanity. This timeline chronicles the twelve precessional ages, each spanning approximately 2,160 years, during which our cosmic creators, the Elohim, guided the development of life on our planet.

From the initial discovery of Earth in the Age of Capricorn to the prophetic revelations awaiting us in the Age of Aquarius, witness how each age brought profound developments in the grand design of creation. This is not merely history—it is the cosmic blueprint of our existence, told through the lens of the Wheel of Heaven.

Prepare to see time not as a linear progression, but as a great wheel turning through the cosmos, each rotation bringing us closer to understanding our true origins and ultimate destiny.
