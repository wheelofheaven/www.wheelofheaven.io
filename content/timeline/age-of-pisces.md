title = "Age of Pisces"
description = "The Age of Pisces, spanning from 210 BC to 1950 AD, succeeded the Age of Aries and recently transitioned into the Age of Aquarius. This era is characterized by significant biblical events, notably the role of Christ, whose mission was to spread the truth of the biblical scriptures worldwide, serving as a foundation for humanity's understanding in the forthcoming age of science. The Age of Aquarius, beginning in 1945 with the development of nuclear power and information systems, symbolizes a time of increased knowledge and technological advancement, enabling humanity to reinterpret ancient wisdom through a modern lens. Additionally, the Age of Pisces included the birth of a significant child, born from a human mother and an extraterrestrial, inheriting unique telepathic abilities, as depicted in the biblical story of the birth of Jesus Christ​​​​​​​​."

## The importance of the Biblical scriptures

> Christ's role was to spread the truth of the biblical scriptures throughout the world, so that they could serve as proof for all of humanity when the age of science would finally explain everything.

The significance of Biblical scriptures lies in their ability to convey essential truths about our existence and the world around us. Christ's mission was to disseminate these truths globally, ensuring their preservation for future generations. In the age of science, the knowledge found in the Bible can be better understood, providing evidence and insights for humanity.

If we consider the Age of Aquarius, which began in 1945 with the development of nuclear power and the advent of information systems, to be synonymous with the age of science, several implications arise. The Age of Aquarius, which will be the main focus in the next chapter bearing the same name, is often associated with a time of increased knowledge, technology, and human potential. In this context, the age of science represents a period where humanity gains a deeper understanding of the world, enabling us to reexamine and reinterpret ancient wisdom, such as the Biblical scriptures, through a modern lens. During the Age of Aquarius, scientific advancements have led to remarkable discoveries and innovations, which have significantly shaped our understanding of the universe and our place within it. The development of nuclear power, for instance, has not only revolutionized energy production but also provided us with a glimpse into the immense power contained within the fabric of matter itself. Similarly, the arrival of information systems has transformed our ability to communicate, share knowledge, and access vast amounts of information at an unprecedented scale.
