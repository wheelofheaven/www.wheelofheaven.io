description = "Elohimian Space Wars, an armed conflict of significant magnitude occurred between two opposing Elohim factions, the timing of which remains undisclosed but is understood to have taken place after the Great Flood. The faction composed of exiled creators, who had been banished to Earth and assisted Noah in preserving life, also gave rise to a hybrid group of Adamites. This faction was in rebellion against the ruling government on their home planet, led by the president of the Council of Eternals, Yahweh. The armed confrontation occurred both on Earth and in the surrounding space. Despite the tension and conflict, Yahweh and his consorts ultimately emerged victorious. However, demonstrating a measure of clemency, Yahweh forgave the exiled creators, allowing them to return to their home planet."
