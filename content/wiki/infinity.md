It conceptualizes infinity as an intrinsic aspect of both space and time, devoid of any central point, beginning, or end. Two ancient symbols known throughout the world and ages testify of this wisdom of old given to us by the Elohim, namely the Swastika representing the cyclical nature of time and timelessness, and Magen David representing in turn that what is above is below, meaning the way space expands to greater macrosopic levels is the same as the way the space within the microscopic levels folds down to. According to the Elohim, humanity's creators, these symbols reveal the intricate symmetry of the universe and advise us to contemplate our existence and actions concerning the individual, society, the creators, and infinity. In essence, infinity is not merely a cosmological concept but the fundamental basis to guide one's life to live in harmony with infinity."

Infinity, an idea that has fascinated minds and found its place in various fields from mathematics to philosophy, refers to an endlessly extending concept, be it in terms of time, space, or quantity. Historically, this abstract notion has served as a cornerstone for various cosmological and philosophical systems, trying to understand and describe the nature of our universe. Today, in the realm of cosmology, it plays a pivotal role in discussions about the universe's structure and extent, with its intricacies and implications continually shaping our understanding of the cosmos. From contemplating infinite time to pondering an infinite universe, the dialogue around infinity is a continuous exploration of our existence within the unfathomable vastness of reality.

## In mathematics

Infinity, represented by the symbol $\\infty$, is a mathematical concept that extends beyond the largest finite number. It is not a conventional number, but rather represents the idea of an unbounded quantity. It has key applications in various branches of mathematics, such as calculus, set theory, and theoretical computer science.

Two distinct concepts of infinity in mathematics are 'potential infinity' and 'actual infinity'. 'Potential infinity' refers to a process that is unending, wherein quantities can continuously increase without limit. For instance, the series of natural numbers (1, 2, 3, ...) can be extended indefinitely, embodying the concept of potential infinity.

'Actual infinity', on the other hand, is a completed totality of infinite quantity. An example is the set of all natural numbers, often denoted as $\\mathbb{N}$. Though it might seem counterintuitive, these concepts have proven invaluable in resolving mathematical paradoxes and in formalizing our understanding of mathematical structures.

Infinity also appears in the study of limits in calculus. Consider the expression $\\lim_{x\\to 0^+}\\frac{1}{x}=\\infty$ and $\\lim_{x\\to 0^-}\\frac{1}{x}=-\\infty$. These represent that as $x$ approaches zero from the positive or negative side respectively, the value of the function $\\frac{1}{x}$ tends towards positive or negative infinity.

It should be noted, however, that arithmetic with infinity does not follow the same rules as finite numbers. For example, adding or subtracting a finite number from infinity still results in infinity ($\\infty + 1 = \\infty$ and $\\infty - 1 = \\infty$).[^calculus]

Moreover, the concept of infinity is not confined to size alone, but also applies to divisibility. For example, there are infinitely many integers, but also infinitely many even integers. Seemingly, there should be twice as many integers as even integers, yet both are infinite. This is an example of 'countably infinite' sets.

In mathematics, infinity is a fundamental concept. While it may sometimes seem paradoxical or counterintuitive, it is integral to a wide range of mathematical theories and is crucial to our understanding of the mathematical universe.

[^calculus]: The idea of infinity is also prevalent in the realm of calculus, particularly when discussing limits. Calculus is a branch of mathematics that deals with rates of change and accumulation, and the concept of limits is a fundamental part of it. Consider the mathematical expression $\\lim_{x\\to 0^+}\\frac{1}{x}=\\infty$ and $\\lim_{x\\to 0^-}\\frac{1}{x}=-\\infty$. The 'lim' part stands for limit, the 'x' is the variable we're interested in, and the '0^+' and '0^-' are indicating that we're looking at what happens when 'x' gets very close to zero from the positive side and the negative side, respectively. Think about it as a thought experiment. What happens if you keep dividing 1 by smaller and smaller positive numbers? As the numbers you divide by become tiny, but stay just above zero (like 0.1, then 0.01, then 0.001, and so on), the result of the division keeps getting larger and larger. That's what we mean by $\\lim_{x\\to 0^+}\\frac{1}{x}=\\infty$ - as 'x' gets very, very close to zero from the positive side, 1 divided by 'x' grows without bound. It tends towards infinity. On the flip side, if you divide 1 by smaller and smaller negative numbers (like -0.1, then -0.01, then -0.001, and so on), the results of your division become larger and larger negative numbers. This is expressed as $\\lim_{x\\to 0^-}\\frac{1}{x}=-\\infty$. As 'x' approaches zero from the negative side, 1 divided by 'x' tends towards negative infinity. This is a fundamental aspect of how infinity works in calculus, encapsulating the intuitive idea that dividing by smaller and smaller amounts results in larger and larger (or more and more negative) outcomes.

## Historical perspective

The concept of an infinite universe has captured human imagination and intellectual inquiry for millennia. Among the ancients, varying views on the vastness of the cosmos emerged.

In Ancient Greece, the Atomist school, founded by Leucippus and Democritus and later expanded by Epicurus, proposed a boundless universe filled with infinite atoms moving in infinite space. Their view contrasted with that of other Greeks, such as Aristotle, who argued for a finite universe with Earth at its center.

The Roman poet Lucretius, a follower of Epicurean philosophy, also propagated the idea of an infinite universe in his philosophical poem "De rerum natura" ("On the Nature of Things").

In the Renaissance, the Italian friar and philosopher Giordano Bruno was a prominent proponent of an infinite universe. Bruno's radical ideas extended beyond spatial infinity; he even suggested the existence of a [plurality of worlds](../cosmic-pluralism.md/). His visionary ideas, which challenged the religious and scientific views of his time, led to his execution as a heretic in 1600.

During the Enlightenment, the concept of an infinite cosmos found proponents in philosopher Immanuel Kant and mathematician Johann Heinrich Lambert, who made theoretical arguments for a universe without end.

In the 20th century, modern cosmology provided new tools to explore the question of infinity. The Steady State theory, popular in the mid-20th century, postulated an infinite, eternal universe with constant matter creation.

However, the development of Big Bang cosmology, largely initiated by Belgian physicist and Catholic priest Georges Lemaître, transformed our understanding of the universe's age. Lemaître proposed that the universe is expanding, a hypothesis that was later claimed to be confirmed by Edwin Hubble's observations.

Despite the groundbreaking nature of Lemaître's theory, it initially faced skepticism, even from notable contemporaries like Albert Einstein. Einstein, who didn't openly dispute Lemaître's mathematical findings, reportedly remarked, "Vos calculs sont corrects, mais votre physique est abominable" (from French: "Your calculations are correct, but your physics is atrocious"). This skepticism would eventually yield to a broader questionable acceptance of an expanding universe, leading to the conception of a universe with a finite age.

The currently favored cosmological model — the ΛCDM model (pronounced Lambda-CDM model) — portrays a universe that is finite but unbounded, like the two-dimensional surface of an inflating balloon.

Nonetheless, the question of the universe's infinity is far from settled. It remains a critical topic in our quest to unify general relativity and quantum mechanics, one of the grand challenges of theoretical physics.

## In Raëlism 🔯

In the first canonical book of [Raëlism](../raelism.md/), The Book Which Tells The Truth (1973), a chapter entitled "Mankind: A Disease of the Universe" explores a conversation with [Yahweh](../yahweh.md/), an entity identified by the Raëlism philosophy as belonging to an advanced extraterrestrial civilization known as the [Elohim](../elohim.md/). These beings are described as the creators of life on Earth, including humans. In this passage, Yahweh shares the Elohim's understanding of their existence within the vast cosmos and their ongoing quest for knowledge.

> Progress continues, and our own research continues for the purpose of understanding and relating to the large being of whom we are a part, and on whose atoms we are parasites. These atoms are the planets and the stars.
>
> In fact, we have been able to discover that intelligent living beings in the infinitely small live on particles that are planets and suns to them. They ask the same questions as ourselves.
>
> Humanity is a disease inside this gigantic being, and the planets and stars are its atoms. Also this same gigantic being is in its turn a parasite on other greater atoms. In both directions, it is infinite. But the important thing is to make sure that the disease, which is humanity, continues to exist and never dies.
>
> [...]

The excerpt represents a profound reflection on the infinite nature of existence, as perceived by the Elohim. Yahweh describes their, but also the human civilization as parasites on the atoms, or in a cosmic sense, the planets and stars, of a larger being. This portrayal echoes the famous concept "as above, so below," indicating that the same patterns are replicated at all levels of the cosmos, from the infinitely large to the infinitely small.

Yahweh reveals the discovery of microscopic, intelligent life forms living on particles that are, to them, analogous to our planets and suns, indicating the existence of infinite realms of life at varying scales.

Furthermore, the passage characterizes humanity as a 'disease' within this macroscopic entity, suggesting a symbiotic or even parasitic relationship. It also posits the infinite nature of existence in both micro and macro directions, creating an intriguing loop of nested realities.

Despite this somewhat stark characterization, the overarching message is one of preservation and continuity of human life. The Elohim's objective, as communicated by Yahweh, is to ensure the ongoing existence of humanity, reflecting an intriguing blend of existential introspection and cosmic awareness.

In the second canonical book of Raëlism, Extraterrestrials Took Me To Their Planet (1976), Yahweh delves deeper into the profound theme of infinity, both in the spatial and temporal dimensions. This dialogue, a continuation of the revelations made in the first book, further expands on the Raëlian understanding of existence and [life\'s origins](../genesis.md/).

> With regard to the origin of life on Earth, some people might say: “Your explanation doesn’t change a thing, since you cannot say what there was at the very beginning.”
>
> This is a foolish comment, which proves that the person who makes it has no awareness of infinity, which exists in time as well as in space. There is neither a beginning nor an end to matter, since “nothing is lost, nothing is created, everything is transformed,” as you have already heard it said. Only the form of matter can change according to the wishes of those who have reached a scientific level, which allows them to accomplish this.
>
> It is the same for the infinite levels of life. That is what the second part of our emblem represents. The Star of David, which is composed of two intertwined triangles, means “as above, so below.” With the swastika, which signifies that everything is cyclic, in the middle of a six-pointed star, you have our emblem, which contains all the wisdom in the world. You can also find the two symbols together in ancient writings like the Bardo Thodol or Tibetan Book of the Dead, and in many other writings as well.
>
> It is evidently very difficult for a finite human brain to be conscious of infinity, which explains the need to limit the universe in time and space by belief in one or several gods that are made responsible for everything.
>
> Indeed, those who cannot reach a sufficient level of human understanding towards the universe have trouble accepting the notion of infinity, which makes humanity nothing exceptional, but merely people situated at a particular time and place in the infinite universe.
>
> [...]

In this passage, Yahweh first addresses a common skepticism about the origin of life, noting that questions seeking a definitive beginning reveal a lack of understanding about infinity. Yahweh asserts the principle of conservation of matter, succinctly encapsulated in the phrase: "nothing is lost, nothing is created, everything is transformed." This concept implies that the essence of existence has always been and will always be, only changing forms over time and space.

The [emblem of Raëlism](../raelian-symbol-of-infinity.md/), represented by the intertwined triangles of the Star of David and the cyclical swastika, encapsulates this wisdom. It signifies "as above, so below," suggesting a universal pattern repeating across all scales of existence, and cyclical time, reinforcing the idea of infinity.

Yahweh acknowledges the challenge posed by infinity to human understanding. Our finite minds tend to seek boundaries, often resorting to the concept of deities to explain the creation and regulation of the universe. This tendency underlines the difficulty in accepting the notion of infinity, which positions humanity as not exceptional, but merely a component in a specific time and place within an infinite universe.

The discourse thereby emphasizes the need for a heightened level of human understanding towards the universe, acknowledging our position within the cosmos and cultivating a deeper comprehension of infinity.

## Infinity in Space

The concept of an infinite universe in space represents the understanding that the universe has no edge, boundary, or center, extending indefinitely in all directions. This idea is inherently associated with the cosmological principle, a cornerstone of modern cosmology, which posits that the universe is isotropic (the same in all directions) and homogeneous (the same at all points) when observed on sufficiently large scales.

Evidence supporting this concept is gleaned from numerous observations. The uniformity and homogeneity of the cosmic microwave background radiation, a relic from the universe's early hot phase, strongly suggests an isotropic and homogeneous universe on large scales.

Moreover, the vastness of the observable universe and the lack of detection of a distinct edge or boundary, despite our advancing technological prowess and expanding knowledge, bolsters the notion of an infinite universe. As our observational limits expand, the cosmos continues to exhibit a strikingly uniform and patterned structure, without discernible limits.

However, it's important to note that asserting the universe's spatial infinity with certainty remains a challenge. While cosmological evidence broadly supports the concept, the ultimate nature and geometry of the universe, and whether it indeed extends indefinitely or is somehow finite yet unbounded, is an ongoing subject of scientific investigation and debate.

### Magen David ✡

The [Magen David](../star-of-david.md/), also known as the Star of David, plays an important role in the understanding of infinity in space as conceptualized in Raëlism. Composed of two intertwined triangles, it signifies "as above, so below," a philosophical principle suggesting that the same patterns are repeated at all scales of the cosmos, from the grandest celestial bodies to the smallest particles.

In the Raëlian cosmology, the Magen David represents the concept that the macroscopic (the universe at large) and the microscopic (particles and smaller scales) are mirror reflections of each other. This mirrors the fractal nature of the universe, which posits that self-similar patterns exist across different scales, tying into the theme of infinity in space.

The Raëlian emblem combines the Magen David with the swastika, another ancient symbol, to symbolize the cyclical nature of time and the interconnection of the macroscopic and microscopic levels of existence. These combined symbols encapsulate the Raëlian understanding of an infinite and cyclical universe.

## Infinity in Time

The concept of infinity in time posits that time, as a fundamental aspect of the universe, has always existed and will continue to do so indefinitely, devoid of a distinct beginning or end. This perspective, transcending the conventional human comprehension of time as linear and finite, provides a profound view of temporal existence in the cosmos.

This notion finds resonance in the fundamental principles of physics. The arrow of time, as understood in thermodynamics, supports the understanding of time as irreversible. The second law of thermodynamics, for instance, states that the entropy of an isolated system will always increase or remain the same over time. Entropy, a measure of disorder or randomness within a system, provides a one-way direction to time, with the past being distinguishably different from the future. This temporal asymmetry underscores the concept of an infinite and unchanging progression of time.

The universe's definite history, as suggested by the progressive increase of entropy, testifies to the continuity and unidirectionality of time. Although our understanding of time continues to evolve, especially with the advent of quantum physics and theories like string theory, the concept of infinite time remains a profound element in our understanding of the cosmos.

### Swastika ࿕

The [swastika](../swastika.md/), an ancient symbol found in numerous cultures around the globe, plays a significant role in representing the concept of infinite time within the Raëlian philosophy. The swastika's four arms, spinning around a central point, embody the cyclical nature of time. This symbol emphasizes the view of time not as a linear progression, but as a cycle that repeats indefinitely, capturing the concept of eternity.

In the context of Raëlism, the swastika is incorporated into their emblem, intertwining with the Star of David. This combination symbolizes the interconnectedness of the macroscopic and microscopic levels of existence, or the "as above, so below" principle, in tandem with the cyclical progression of time.

The emblem as a whole, therefore, encapsulates the Raëlian understanding of an infinite and cyclical universe in both spatial and temporal dimensions, with the swastika particularly highlighting the everlasting cyclical nature of time.

## Life above and below

The following excerpt from the second canonical book of Raëlism, "Extraterrestrials Took Me To Their Planet" (1976), sheds further light on the Elohim's understanding of life across the macroscopic and microscopic levels. It also introduces a key physical concept, the [Law of Masstime](../mass-effect.md/), relating time's flow to the mass or scale of a life form.

> You also know that we have discovered that there is organized, intelligent life on the level of the infinitely small, quite certainly as evolved as we are and comparable to what we are ourselves.  We have been able to prove this.
>
> From there, we have discovered that the stars and planets are the atoms of a gigantic being, which itself certainly contemplates other stars with curiosity. It is also highly likely that the people living on the infinitely small levels of the infinitely large person and his fellow creatures have known periods when they believed in an immaterial “God”.
>
> You must fully understand that everything is in everything. At this moment in an atom of your arm, millions of worlds are being born and others are dying, believing or not believing in a “God” and a soul, and when a millennium has gone by for you, the gigantic being of whom the sun is an atom has only had the time to take one step.
>
> Time is, in fact, inversely proportional to the mass, or rather to the level of the form of life. But everything in the universe is alive and in harmony with the infinitely large and the infinitely small.
>
> The Earth is alive like all the planets, and for the small growth that is humanity, it is difficult to notice this because of the time lag due to the enormous difference in mass, which prevents you from perceiving its palpitations. Nor could one of our red blood cells, or better still, one of the atoms that make up our body imagine that it forms, with its peers, a living being.
>
> Finally, whatever happens to each individual, the universal balance remains constant. But if we want to be happy at our level, we must live in harmony with the infinitely large, the infinitely small, and with our fellow human beings.
>
> No argument aiming to support the existence of any type of god or soul can be sustained when we glimpse, however briefly, at the infinite nature of the universe. No heaven could exist in any particular place because, since the universe is infinite, it cannot have a center. Besides, as I have already explained, there cannot be any communication between an infinitely large entity and a universe of infinitely small entities, because the difference in mass is too great, thus creating a difference in the flow of equivalent time.

In this passage, Yahweh conveys the Elohim's discoveries of organized, intelligent life at the infinitely small scale, akin to their own advanced civilization. The stars and planets, according to this perspective, are atoms within a gigantic entity, implying a complex nested structure of existence, where everything is contained within everything else. He presents the concept of time as being inversely proportional to the mass or scale of the form of life - a fundamental principle they term the "Law of Masstime", or simply "Mass Effect". This idea dictates that what may be a millennium for humans could be equivalent to a single step for a cosmic entity, for whom the sun is but an atom.

Yahweh further emphasizes that all things in the universe, including the Earth, are alive and harmoniously connected across the infinitely large and infinitely small scales. However, he acknowledges the difficulty humans face in perceiving this universal life due to the immense difference in mass and associated time lag.

The passage concludes by arguing against the existence of any specific god or soul, given the infinite nature of the universe and its lack of a central point. Any interaction between infinitely large and infinitely small entities is deemed impossible due to the vast difference in mass and consequent discrepancy in the flow of time. The underlying message stresses the importance of living in harmony with the infinite dimensions of existence and fellow human beings for achieving happiness at our own level of existence.

{{< figure src="/images/hubble-cosmic-web.jpg" alt="hubble-cosmic-web.jpg" caption="Artistic rendering titled \"The Cosmic Web\" by Volker Springel (Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics) et al. \"In shaping the Universe, gravity builds a vast cobweb-like structure of filaments tying galaxies and clusters of galaxies together along invisible bridges hundreds of millions of light-years long. This is known as the cosmic web.\"" >}}

The concept of the "vast difference in mass and consequent discrepancy in the flow of time" suggests that the experience of time is relative to the scale or mass of the observer. This is an idea presented in the Raëlian literature, coined as the Law of Masstime, though it's not a principle that has been recognized nor validated by mainstream physics as of today.[^mainstream]

This law posits that a larger entity with a greater mass would experience time slower than a smaller entity with a lesser mass. For instance, for a cosmic entity so large that a star like our Sun is just an atom to it, what we perceive as a thousand years (a millennium) might only feel like a momentary step for that entity. This is due to the differences in the scales of existence - the cosmic entity exists at a much larger scale than humans. On the other side of the spectrum, at the microcosmic level where particles or atoms could represent entire worlds, time could be experienced at a much faster rate. A single moment for us could equate to entire epochs at that level.

[^mainstream]: The theory of general relativity, the widely accepted framework in physics for understanding gravitation, also suggests time dilation effects due to gravity and velocity differences, but it does not make claims in the same manner as the Law of Masstime as laid out here. See here for more: [General relativity | Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity)

## Harmony with infinity

In the last passage, the phrase, "Finally, whatever happens to each individual, the universal balance remains constant," suggests a worldview that recognizes the natural order or balance of the universe, irrespective of individual experiences or circumstances. It encapsulates a belief in the inherent equilibrium of existence, with the universe maintaining its balance regardless of what transpires at the individual level. This could be interpreted as a statement about the relative insignificance of individual actions, experiences, or existence in the face of the grandeur and scale of the universe.

The following statement, "But if we want to be happy at our level, we must live in harmony with the infinitely large, the infinitely small, and with our fellow human beings," offers a prescription for contentment or happiness. It posits that to achieve happiness, one must strive for a state of harmony with all aspects of existence: the macroscopic ("infinitely large"), the microscopic ("infinitely small"), and the interpersonal ("our fellow human beings").

The "infinitely large" could refer to the grand scale of the universe and our place within it, while the "infinitely small" could be interpreted as the minuscule, yet complex, elements that make up our world, such as atoms or even subatomic particles. Recognizing and appreciating our connection and relationship to both of these scales of existence is suggested as a pathway to happiness.

Lastly, the reference to living in harmony with "our fellow human beings" suggests the importance of empathy, compassion, mutual understanding, and cooperative living. It implies that our relationships with others—how we treat them and how we allow ourselves to be treated—are crucial components of our overall well-being and happiness.

These statements together present a holistic approach to happiness that encompasses a comprehensive understanding of our place in the universe, from the grandest cosmic scale to the minutiae of atomic structures, along with the importance of human connection and community.

In the Raëlian philosophy, as elaborated in their second canonical book "Extraterrestrials Took Me To Their Planet" (1976), a specific guidance is provided on how to perceive and assess situations. This guidance is expressed through the [Four Levels of Consideration](../four-levels-of-consideration.md/):

> In every situation, we must always consider things in regard to four levels:
>
> - In relation to infinity;
>
> - In relation to the Elohim, our parents and creators;
>
> - In relation to human society;
>
> - And finally, in relation to the individual.
>
> The most important level is that relating to infinity, for it is in relation to this level that all things must be judged - but always with one constant factor: love. This means taking others into account, who must be given love, because we must live in harmony with infinity, and to do this we must live in harmony with others, because they are a part of infinity as well.

Raëlism instructs its adherents to approach every situation considering four distinct levels: 1) in relation to infinity, 2) in relation to the Elohim, who are conceived as humanity's creators, 3) in relation to human society, and 4) in relation to the individual. The highest significance is ascribed to the level concerning infinity, as all things are to be judged in relation to it. However, one universal constant transcends all these levels: love.

This guidance posits that to fully grasp any situation, one must take into account its implications on the vast scale of the infinite cosmos, on our creators (as per Raëlian belief), on society, and on the individual. To exist in harmony with infinity, which includes everyone and everything, it advocates living with love and consideration for others. Thus, the approach endorses a cosmically aware perspective imbued with empathy and compassion, viewing all life as an integral part of the grandeur of infinity.
