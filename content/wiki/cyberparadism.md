Cyberparadism is an aesthetic that envisions a harmonious integration of advanced technology with the natural world, leading to a state of prosperity and abundance. It emphasizes the transformative power of technology, the interconnectedness of communities, and the importance of collective goals such as the embetterment of the human condition through technology. The typical Cyberparadism setting can be a utopian society on Earth having overcome intercultural enmity or otherworldly tech-based pantropic frontier communities. At its core, Cyberparadism celebrates a future where technology acts as a bridge, enhancing and harmonizing with the diversity and the genetic makeup of life."

Cyberparadism is a contemporary aesthetic that paints a vision of the future where technology and nature seamlessly coexist, leading to unparalleled prosperity and abundance. Rooted in the belief of the positive potential of technological advancements, this aesthetic extends beyond mere tools and machines. It envisions a reshaped societal structure where interconnected communities collaborate towards shared objectives, with environmental preservation and the enhancement of life being paramount.

Structurally, Cyberparadism finds its lineage in the realms of Cyberprep, Post-Cyberpunk, and Solarpunk. It combines cybernetic themes with paradisiacal elements, often portraying either a utopian society or a literal paradise reminiscent of the Garden of Eden. While it shares the optimism of Cyberprep and the eco-consciousness of Solarpunk, Cyberparadism diverges by emphasizing not just the benefits of technological advancement but also how such advancements have profoundly transformed economic principles and labor dynamics. This encourages societies to pursue loftier goals in science, technology, civilization, and spirituality.

Societal structures within Cyberparadism mirror this aspiration. Highly interconnected small communities or dense urban pods collaborate, working towards objectives like environmental conservation or advanced scientific research. This spirit of cooperation, facilitated by the advanced technology of a post-scarcity society, is a hallmark of Cyberparadism.

At its core, the paradisal aspect of Cyberparadism is not merely an aesthetic choice; it's foundational to its philosophy. It champions a future where technology not only enhances but also safeguards the natural world. This aesthetic refutes the idea that progress must come at the cost of the environment, instead championing a vision where humans and nature thrive in harmonious coexistence.

## Setting

The world of Cyberparadism is a tapestry of diverse landscapes and habitats, each echoing the aesthetic's core principles. On Earth, the settings often depict societies that have achieved a harmonious balance between technological advancement and nature. These societies might be nestled in lush, untouched forests, or perched atop serene coastal cliffs, always ensuring minimal disruption to the environment. The architecture, while advanced, often borrows elements from the surrounding nature, creating structures that seem as if they've grown from the land itself.

Venturing beyond Earth, the aesthetic paints a vision of minimalist habitats on distant planets or space frontiers. These extraterrestrial settings, while stark and alien, still carry the ethos of Cyberparadism. Advanced terraforming technologies might transform barren landscapes into thriving ecosystems, or biodomes might dot the horizons, each a self-contained oasis. Whether on Earth or another planet, the emphasis remains on creating spaces that are sustainable, efficient, and in harmony with the environment. The blend of advanced technology with organic design ensures that every setting, no matter how futuristic, feels rooted in nature and community.

## Visuals

Cyberparadism, as an aesthetic, is a visual symphony that harmoniously blends the cutting-edge sophistication of technology with the raw, unbridled beauty of nature. The visuals serve not just as a feast for the eyes but as a narrative, telling the story of a world where humanity's technological prowess is used to enhance, rather than exploit, the natural environment.

The architectural designs within this aesthetic are characterized by sleek, minimalist lines, often juxtaposed against the backdrop of dense forests, cascading waterfalls, or expansive beaches. These structures, while futuristic, often incorporate organic elements, making them appear as if they are extensions of the environment rather than intrusions. The use of simple geometric shapes, such as spheres, domes, and hexagons, is prevalent. These shapes, while evoking a sense of advanced design, also mirror patterns found in nature, symbolizing the seamless integration of the built environment with the natural world.

Color plays a pivotal role in the Cyberparadism aesthetic. A palette dominated by shades like teal, aquamarine, and aerospace orange paints a picture that is both vibrant and serene. These colors, reminiscent of the deep oceans and expansive skies, evoke feelings of wonder, exploration, and tranquility. They serve as a reminder of the world's vastness and the endless possibilities that lie ahead.

## Depiction in media

There are a few movies that can be mentioned that each depict elements of the Cyberparadism aesthetic:

- "Jurassic World" (2015): In this movie, the theme park, which is filled with genetically engineered dinosaurs, is a prime example of the Cyberparadism aesthetic. The park represents an advanced use of technology, in this case genetic engineering, to recreate prehistoric life forms and coexist with them in a lush, tropical environment. It blends the untamed wilderness of the past with the high-tech reality of the present, making it a paradisal place despite the inherent dangers.

- "Elysium" (2013): The orbital ring-world Elysium depicts a different form of Cyberparadism. This space habitat is filled with beautiful landscapes, luxury homes, and highly advanced medical technology that can cure all diseases, representing a sort of utopia or paradise. However, the paradisal aspect is only available to the wealthy, leading to social inequality, which contradicts the egalitarian principles usually associated with Cyberparadism. Still, the aesthetic can be seen in the combination of advanced technology and an idyllic living environment.

- "Oblivion" (2013): In the beginning scenes of the movie, the protagonist lives in a high-tech tower above the clouds, with a stunning view of the earth below. This represents a form of Cyberparadism in the sense that he lives in a highly advanced dwelling, with sophisticated technology, above a desolate Earth. The harmony with nature is achieved by leaving nature thrive on its own having a habitats that are well isolated form nature and fusion energy generators deployed on top the oceans.

## Our take

The Cyberparadism aesthetic, with its emphasis on the harmonious coexistence of advanced technology and nature, resonates deeply with the core tenets of the Wheel of Heaven's working hypothesis. At the heart of both is the idea of [creation](../intelligent-design.md/), not through divine intervention, but through a profound understanding of science and genetics. This hypothesis, based on the [Raëlian revelations](../raelism.md/), describes a world where life on Earth is the result of deliberate creation by extraterrestrial beings, the [Elohim](../elohim.md/), who possess an advanced mastery over DNA. This mirrors the Cyberparadism vision of a future where technology, especially in the realm of genetics and cellular biology, is harnessed to create a utopia.

The setting of Cyberparadism, where Earth-based utopian societies thrive in harmony with nature, can be likened to the [Garden of Eden](../eden.md/) or the "terrestrial paradise" referenced several times here on the Wheel of Heaven. This paradise, a laboratory where humans were created and initially lived in ease, mirrors the Cyberparadism ideal of a world where technology and nature coexist without conflict, and where humans benefit from both without exploitation.
