Wheel of Heaven is a model, not a creed. It treats many ancient stories as compressed records rather than supernatural reports. In this reading, “gods” are not spirits but an advanced, human-like civilization—the Elohim—whose technology, statecraft, and teaching were filtered through the languages and imaginations of earlier cultures.

The second anchor is the sky itself. Earth’s axis slowly wobbles, and over long spans the equinoxes point to different constellations. This slow drift—precession—creates a natural clock of “Ages.” Wheel of Heaven uses that clock to organize history: similar motifs tend to reappear when the sky’s markers repeat. The heavens are not a horoscope here; they are a timeline.

This approach asks a simple question whenever a story looks miraculous: what would this look like if it were engineering, medicine, optics, or psychology observed from the outside? Temples become interfaces. Prophets look like emissaries. Myth becomes a compression layer that preserves signal while changing its shape.

None of this works without method. Claims are provisional and meant to be updated. Astronomy, archaeology, and philology act as our instruments. When evidence strengthens, confidence rises; when it weakens, we let go. The goal is clarity, not certainty.

The ethics are practical and light: create with care, respect consent, stay curious. Technology is sacred only insofar as it protects and cultivates life. You do not have to "believe" to explore; you only need a willingness to test ideas against the world.
