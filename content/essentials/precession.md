# Precession 101: The Sky’s Slow Clock

Stand outside at dawn and imagine the sky as a grand, patient instrument. Earth spins like a top, and like any top it also wobbles—very slowly. Because of that wobble, the backdrop of stars behind the rising Sun at the equinox shifts over long spans of time. Across millennia, the equinox points to different constellations, and the whole cycle takes about twenty-six thousand years to complete. This motion is called **precession**.

Precession does not change your day, but it changes the frame of ages. It is a clock so slow that an individual lifetime barely notices it, yet steady enough to mark epochs. Ancient builders and storytellers seem to have watched this drift, encoding it in orientations, symbols, and calendars. When cultures speak of an “Age,” they are often pointing—directly or indirectly—to which constellation the equinox rose in when their stories were set.

For Wheel of Heaven, precession is not a horoscope. It is a timeline. It doesn’t tell you who you are; it helps us place when a pattern belonged. If similar motifs, animals, and numbers recur when the sky’s marker returns to a familiar place, that hints at a shared schedule encoded in myth and stone. The clock does not cause events; it lets us see rhythms that would otherwise hide inside the blur of history.

This is why precession sits at the center of the project. It offers a neutral reference that anyone can check, regardless of belief. When a claim aligns with the sky's slow dial, with the text, and with material traces on the ground, it earns attention. When it does not, we adjust. The aim is simple: let the heavens give us a yardstick, then read the past with clearer eyes.
